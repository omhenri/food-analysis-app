# Enhanced Weekly Report Implementation - Task 15.6

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of task 15.6: "Enhance weekly reports with sophisticated visualization" from the food analysis app specification.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Weekly Report Service
**File:** `src/services/WeeklyReportService.ts`

**New Interfaces Added:**
- `WeeklyTrendAnalysis` - Week-over-week comparison and consistency tracking
- `WeeklyNutritionScore` - Daily scores, trends, and goal tracking
- Enhanced `WeeklyReportData` with new fields:
  - `enhancedWeeklyComparison: EnhancedComparisonData[]`
  - `trendAnalysis: WeeklyTrendAnalysis`
  - `nutritionScore: WeeklyNutritionScore`

**New Methods Added:**
- `calculateEnhancedWeeklyConsumption()` - Enhanced daily analysis with nutrition scores
- `generateEnhancedWeeklyComparison()` - Weekly totals with layered visualization
- `generateWeeklyTrendAnalysis()` - Week-over-week comparison and trend analysis
- `generateWeeklyNutritionScore()` - Daily scores and weekly goal tracking
- Helper methods for trend analysis and goal assessment

### 2. Enhanced Weekly Comparison Card Component
**File:** `src/components/EnhancedWeeklyComparisonCard.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Layered Progress Bars:** Multi-layered horizontal bars with different heights (4px main, 2px reference)
- **Daily Breakdown Overlay:** Expandable daily consumption bars with status indicators
- **Weekly Average Line:** Visual indicator of weekly average consumption
- **Reference Value Indicators:** Circular indicators (2px) at reference points
- **Interactive Elements:** Tap for details, toggle for daily breakdown
- **Consistency Insights:** Visual indication of daily variation levels

**Visual Design:**
- Substance name (12px Roboto)
- Consumption value (22px Roboto, right-aligned)
- Unit indicator (8px Roboto light)
- Color-coded status indicators
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 3. Weekly Trend Indicator Component
**File:** `src/components/WeeklyTrendIndicator.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Week-over-Week Comparison:** Nutrition score and calorie changes with trend icons
- **Improving/Declining Nutrients:** Lists of substances with status changes
- **Consistency Score:** Tracking consistency with visual indicators
- **Daily Variation Insights:** Top substances with highest variation
- **Trend Visualization:** Icons and colors for trend direction

### 4. Weekly Nutrition Score Widget
**File:** `src/components/WeeklyNutritionScoreWidget.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Circular Progress Indicator:** Overall nutrition score (0-100) with color coding
- **Daily Score Bars:** Individual daily scores with trend visualization
- **Category Breakdown:** Macronutrients, micronutrients, harmful substances scores
- **Weekly Goals Tracking:** Achieved, partially achieved, and missed goals
- **Trend Indicators:** Improving, declining, or stable trends

### 5. Enhanced Weekly Report Screen
**File:** `src/screens/WeeklyReportScreen.tsx`

**New Views Added:**
- **Enhanced View:** Weekly nutrition score widget + enhanced comparison cards
- **Trends View:** Trend analysis + detailed weekly breakdown with daily overlay
- **Updated Navigation:** Horizontal scrollable tabs for better UX

**View Structure:**
1. **Summary** - Original overview with key metrics
2. **Enhanced** - Sophisticated visualization with layered progress bars
3. **Trends** - Week-over-week analysis and daily variation insights
4. **Basic** - Original comparison view (renamed from "Comparison")
5. **Daily** - Daily breakdown view

### 6. Type Definitions
**File:** `src/models/types.ts`

**New Types Added:**
- `EnhancedComparisonData` with weekly-specific properties:
  - `dailyBreakdown` - Daily values and status for each day
  - `weeklyAverage` - Average daily consumption
  - `dailyVariation` - Standard deviation of daily values

## Technical Implementation Details

### Weekly-Specific Reference Values
- Daily reference values multiplied by 7 for weekly totals
- Appropriate ranges calculated for weekly consumption patterns
- Color-coded reference lines (blue for recommended, pink for limits)

### Daily Breakdown Overlay
- Mini bar charts showing daily consumption for each substance
- Color-coded by nutritional status (optimal, deficient, excess)
- Expandable/collapsible interface for detailed insights
- Weekly average line overlay for context

### Week-over-Week Comparison
- Automatic comparison with previous week when available
- Trend indicators for nutrition score and calorie changes
- Lists of improving and declining nutrients
- Consistency scoring based on tracking frequency

### Layered Progress Visualization
- **Main consumption bars:** 4px height, theme color (#75F5DB)
- **Secondary layers:** Gradient colors (#67C7C1, #509A9C) for reference values
- **Reference lines:** 2px height, blue (#4A78CF) and pink (#EA92BD)
- **Circular indicators:** 2px diameter at reference points
- **Smooth animations:** 800ms duration with native driver

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient calculation of weekly totals from daily data
- Lazy loading of daily breakdown overlays
- Optimized rendering for large datasets
- Memory-efficient color calculations

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **10.1** - Weekly totals vs weekly recommended values using layered progress bars
✅ **10.2** - Daily breakdown overlay on weekly bars for detailed insights  
✅ **10.3** - Week-over-week comparison with trend indicators
✅ **10.4** - Weekly-specific reference values (daily × 7) with appropriate ranges
✅ **10.5** - Weekly nutrition score and trend analysis

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Generate enhanced weekly report
const weeklyReport = await WeeklyReportService.getInstance().generateWeeklyReport(weekId);

// Access enhanced features
const enhancedComparison = weeklyReport.enhancedWeeklyComparison;
const trendAnalysis = weeklyReport.trendAnalysis;
const nutritionScore = weeklyReport.nutritionScore;

// Render enhanced components
<EnhancedWeeklyComparisonCard 
  data={enhancedComparison[0]} 
  showDailyBreakdown={true}
  animated={true}
/>

<WeeklyTrendIndicator trendAnalysis={trendAnalysis} />
<WeeklyNutritionScoreWidget nutritionScore={nutritionScore} />
```

## Testing Considerations

The implementation includes:
- Error handling for missing data scenarios
- Graceful degradation when previous week data is unavailable
- Proper type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- Accessibility support for screen readers
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Interactive drill-down from weekly to daily views
- Export functionality for weekly reports
- Customizable goal setting and tracking
- Integration with health apps for additional context
- Machine learning insights for personalized recommendations
