# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Food Analysis Mobile App is a cross-platform application that allows users to input their daily meals, analyze the nutritional content and chemical substances in their food, and track their consumption patterns over time.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compare my consumption against recommended daily intake, so that I can make informed dietary decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the comparison button THEN the system SHALL analyze recommended absorption for adults aged 18-29
2. WHEN comparison analysis runs THEN the system SHALL calculate total daily consumption for each chemical substance
3. WHEN comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL display consumption vs recommended absorption comparison
4. WHEN displaying comparison THEN the system SHALL show data in grams for each chemical substance
5. IF consumption exceeds recommendations THEN the system SHALL highlight this information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my food data to be stored locally, so that I can access my meal history even when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters food data THEN the system SHALL store it in a local SQLite database
2. WHEN the user first opens the app THEN the system SHALL create a "Day 1" record
3. WHEN the user opens the app on subsequent days THEN the system SHALL increment the day counter
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL associate all entries with the current day number
5. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL still allow data storage and retrieval

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my past meal records, so that I can track my eating patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches to the past records tab THEN the system SHALL display a list of previous days
2. WHEN the user selects a specific day THEN the system SHALL show all meals recorded for that day
3. WHEN viewing past records THEN the system SHALL allow scrolling through different days
4. WHEN displaying past data THEN the system SHALL show the same analysis information as the current day
5. WHEN no data exists for a day THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate weekly reports, so that I can understand my overall nutritional patterns across a week.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user reaches Day 7 THEN the system SHALL enable the weekly report button
2. WHEN the user clicks weekly report THEN the system SHALL combine data from Days 1-7
3. WHEN generating weekly report THEN the system SHALL calculate total weekly consumption for each chemical substance
4. WHEN displaying weekly report THEN the system SHALL compare weekly consumption against weekly recommended intake
5. WHEN weekly report is complete THEN the system SHALL show the same format as daily comparison but with weekly totals

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see sophisticated nutritional visualizations with layered progress bars and multiple reference values, so that I can better understand my consumption patterns and health status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing comparison data THEN the system SHALL display multi-layered horizontal progress bars with different heights (4px main, 2px reference)
2. WHEN displaying substance information THEN the system SHALL show substance name (12px), consumption value (22px right-aligned), and unit indicator (8px)
3. WHEN showing reference values THEN the system SHALL display color-coded reference points with small circular indicators (2px)
4. WHEN displaying progress bars THEN the system SHALL use theme color (#75F5DB) for primary consumption and gradient variations (#67C7C1, #509A9C) for secondary layers
5. WHEN showing reference lines THEN the system SHALL use blue (#4A78CF) for recommended values and pink (#EA92BD) for limit values

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want substances categorized by type with appropriate reference ranges, so that I can understand different nutritional requirements and safety thresholds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying calories THEN the system SHALL show daily intake vs recommended with activity level adjustments

3. WHEN displaying micronutrients (Vitamins, Minerals) THEN the system SHALL show RDA and upper limits with appropriate indicators
4. WHEN showing harmful substances THEN the system SHALL display safety thresholds with warning indicators
5. WHEN substances are grouped THEN the system SHALL organize by category (Macronutrients, Vitamins, Minerals, etc.) in collapsible sections

### Requirement 9
